**Problems observed**

* Visual inconsistency between screens (light vs. dark, gradients, badges, card elevation).
* “Demo template” vibe: generic icons, placeholder image blocks, minimal motion.
* Typography + spacing vary by page; some cramped, some airy.
* Low contrast in gradients/dark mode areas; illegible small labels; excessively precise numbers (e.g., `46.219853...%`).
* Inconsistent button variants (ghost/outline/solid/gradient), disabled state styling not uniform.
* Iconography mixed weights; some missing icons (blank tiles in proof type grid).
* Bottom nav is present but top-level context/breadcrumbs vary.

**Tasks**

1. **Design Tokens v1 (Figma + code)**

   * Colors (light/dark + high-contrast), typography scale, radius, elevation, spacing, motion durations/curves, shadows, borders.
   * Tailwind CSS variables + CSS custom properties for light/dark/high-contrast.
   * **Done when:** tokens exist in Figma + exported to code; app compiles with tokens only.

2. **Component Library Unification (shadcn/radix variants)**

   * Buttons (primary/secondary/tertiary/danger/quiet), Inputs, Select, DatePicker, Tabs, SegmentedControl, Cards, EmptyState, Toast, Badge/StatusPill, Stepper, Modal/Sheet, Toolbar, Data Tiles, Tag, Pagination, Table, Stat KPIs, Progress, Skeleton, Tooltip, Dropdown, Alert, Banner.
   * **Done when:** All pages use these components; no screen-level bespoke styles.

3. **Icon System**

   * Switch fully to **Lucide** (single set), 1.5px stroke, size 18/20/24 with consistent padding.
   * Create 8–12 **Veridity custom glyphs** (ZK shield, QR verify, Proof, Wallet, Audit, AI shield, Chain, GOV).
   * **Done when:** No “blank image squares” in tiles; icons mapped in tokens.

4. **Typography + Density**

   * Type ramp (H1: 28/36, H2: 22/28, H3: 18/24, Body: 14/20, Small: 12/18).
   * Line-height rules + max 80ch width for long text.
   * **Done when:** All headings/body follow ramp; truncation handled with tooltip.

5. **Theme + Modes**

   * Light default; Dark polished (true dark, not grey), **High-contrast** AAA mode.
   * Remove harsh multicolor gradients behind form pages. Replace with subtle noise/soft radial.
   * **Done when:** WCAG AA for text/icons; theme toggle persisted.

6. **Motion & Micro-Interactions**

   * Page transitions (fade/slide 120ms), button hover/press, empty-state micro-motion, QR success pulse, share countdown tick.
   * **Done when:** Motion tokens used; prefers-reduced-motion respected.

## P0 — Critical UX Bugs & Accessibility

**Observed**

* **Language toggle** in Voice Settings selects the *other* tab (English press → Nepali highlights).
* **Nepali/English TTS** quality poor; wrong voices; rate/pitch controls ineffective.
* **Select dropdown z-index/portal bug**: province select overlays labels/fields.
* Disabled CTA “Proceed to Generate” state ambiguous; no inline validation hints.
* Inconsistent date formats; mixed placeholders.
* Contrast issues in dark/share/history screens.

**Tasks**

1. **Fix Language Toggle Logic (Tabs/Segmented Control)**

   * Bind active state to value, not index; RTL/LTR safe.
   * **Acceptance:** Pressing “English” highlights English; persists across route.

2. **Replace TTS Provider + Fallback**

   * Use high-quality TTS (e.g., local on-device where possible) with **ne-NP** voice; fallback to cloud with caching.
   * Expose **rate (0.8–1.2)** and **pitch (-2…+2)**; save per-language.
   * **Acceptance:** Sample sentences in EN/NE are intelligible; MOS ≥ 4 in internal QA.

3. **Select / DatePicker via Radix + Portal**

   * Use Radix Select with `Portal`; fix stacking context (`z-50`), collision detection, and scroll locking.
   * **Acceptance:** No overlapping inputs; mobile sheet pattern for selects.

4. **Validation & CTA Clarity**

   * Inline validation messages under fields; CTA shows reason when disabled.
   * **Acceptance:** With any missing required field, CTA disabled + helper text explains.

5. **A11y Pass (WCAG 2.2 AA)**

   * Focus outlines visible; skip-to-content; roles for nav/main; ARIA on steppers; keyboard trap elimination.
   * **Acceptance:** Axe score 100%; tab order matches visual order.

## P1 — Page-by-Page Improvements

### 1) **Welcome / Portal Switcher**

**Findings**

* Sparse white space; reads like a dashboard template.
* “Switch Role (Demo)” small; role context unclear.

**Tasks**

* Add **hero identity strip** (user avatar, role chip, environment badge).
* Convert three portal tiles to **card grid** with brief bullets + icon.
* Add **Quick Start** (Generate Proof, Scan QR, View Docs).
* **Acceptance:** 5s test—users identify where to go next without reading dense text.

---

### 2) **Customer Portal (My Identity)**

**Findings**

* KPI tiles basic; no trends or next best action.
* Expiring proofs banner shows negative “-423 days” (confusing).
* Quick actions look like simple list items.

**Tasks**

* KPI tiles: add trend chevrons; secondary metric badge (growth %).
* Expiring proofs: show **“Expired”** state with action “Renew now”.
* Quick Actions → **Action Cards** with icons and short help text.
* Profile Overview: surface **verification level**, backup status, passkey status.
* **Acceptance:** No negative day counts; actions are card-based with icons.

---

### 3) **Proof Generation Flow (Type → Enter Data → Generate)**

**Findings**

* Beautiful structure, but: placeholder icons, form alignment, privacy note blends in, stepper light.
* Disabled primary CTA unclear; tooltips missing on labels (e.g., Minimum Age).
* Input types could be smarter (numeric keyboard, masks).

**Tasks**

* Add **illustrated icons** per proof type (Address/Age/Citizenship/Education/Income).
* Elevate **Privacy Note** (shield icon + info link).
* Stepper with **current/complete** states + mobile sticky footer for CTA.
* Field improvements:

  * `DOB`: masked input + date picker; min/max age checks.
  * `Citizenship No.`: pattern + checksum (if applicable), **verifier-side hashing**.
  * `Income`: numeric keypad, thousand separators while typing.
  * `Education Level`: controlled vocabulary + auto-fill **institution** list (local cache).
* **Acceptance:** Zero layout overlap; form completion success < 90s for first-time user.

---

### 4) **Share (QR, Link, PDF)**

**Findings**

* Dark panel is stylish; QR section dominant (good). Countdown text small; share buttons under-emphasized; “Privacy Protected” note tiny.

**Tasks**

* Move countdown into **pill timer** above QR; animate subtle sweep.
* Share actions row: **Copy Link / Share / Save PDF** as primary buttons with clear hierarchy.
* “Privacy Protected” → info card with link to **What’s shared?** (public signals only).
* **Acceptance:** Users can copy link in < 2s; clear that only proof is shared.

---

### 5) **History**

**Findings**

* Great filters; list items minimal; no details peek.
* Export PDF button cramped near list.

**Tasks**

* Each item: show **verifier**, **scope**, **expiry**, **status pill** (verified/pending/failed), **actions** (View, Share, Revoke).
* Add **row expand** for proof meta (public signals hash, created, circuit version).
* Move Export to top toolbar; allow **CSV/PDF**.
* **Acceptance:** Users can find last verified proof in < 5s; export under 3 clicks.

---

### 6) **Settings / Wallet Backup**

**Findings**

* Solid content: Passkey, Recovery phrase. But controls are plain; auto-delete proofs duration stepper tiny; section contrast low.

**Tasks**

* Turn **Passkey** + **Recovery Phrase** into **setup cards** with progress and risk labels.
* Auto-delete proofs: **Segmented control** (Off / 7d / 30d / 90d / Custom).
* Group **Privacy & Security** with toggles: Notifications, Biometrics, High-contrast Mode.
* **Acceptance:** Backup completion path is 2 steps; duration control big, tappable.

---

### 7) **Organization Dashboard (Client Portal)**

**Findings**

* KPIs good, but **Quick Actions** look like text fields; activity lacks visual hierarchy.

**Tasks**

* KPI cards → add **sparkline** and badge (↑/↓).
* Quick Actions → **primary action cards** with icons (API key, Webhooks, SDK, Docs).
* Recent Activity → timeline with category chips (Security/Billing/Team).
* **Acceptance:** Time-to-API-key generation < 3 clicks from entry.

---

### 8) **Admin Portal: Dashboard / Users / Security / System / Analytics / Support**

**Findings**

* Memory usage shows long decimals; uptime “0 days, 0 hours”; analytics chart grid empty placeholders.
* Security events readable but no severity colors; access control list looks like static text.
* Support pane good but “Live chat console” CTA is text only.

**Tasks**

* Format KPIs to **one decimal**; friendly units (e.g., 46.2%).
* Uptime should show **rolling 30-day** + incidents log link.
* Security Events: severity tags (High/Med/Low) with color; link to event detail.
* Access Control: turn policies into **toggle list** with tooltips & edit drawers.
* Analytics: show **real charts** (stacked area for proofs, line for latency).
* Support: **Open Chat Console** as a button; queues in table with SLA badge.
* **Acceptance:** No fake numbers; every tile clickable; charts populated with mock or real series.

* **Acceptance:** Readability test (Hemingway grade ≤ 6).

---

## P1 — Internationalization, Localization, and Date/Number Formats

**Tasks**

* **Locale-aware** formatting for dates (e.g., `6 Sep 2025, 7:59 PM`) and numbers (`1,247,891`).
* Nepali language: audit all strings (remove leftover keys like `form.minimumAge` ghosts).
